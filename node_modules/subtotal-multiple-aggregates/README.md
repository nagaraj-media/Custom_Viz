# Subtotal with Multiple Aggregates

This is a JavaScript plugin for [PivotTable.js](https://pivottable.js.org/examples/). It renders rows and columns of a pivot table with subtotals and lets the user expand or collapse rows and columns. It has been forked from [Subtotal.js](http://nagarajanchinnasamy.com/subtotal) to provide support for multiple aggregates.

This plugin has been designed for use with the [Looker Custom Visualization API](https://github.com/looker/visualization-api-examples) and includes Looker-specific styles and themes. See that repository for details.
